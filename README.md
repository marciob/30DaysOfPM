# 30 Days of Product Management Challenge #30DaysOfPM

## Overview

This repository documents my journey through a [#30DaysofPM](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/30-days-of-pm) challenge. Each day, I delve into different aspects of Product Management, from understanding user needs to collaborating with development teams.

## Daily Breakdown

### What is a Product Manager?

<img src="/images/octopus.png" width="500" alt="Octopus Product Manager">

**An Octopus Connecting All Parts:** I like to think of a PM as an octopus connecting all the parts of the product to make it work well.

### Who is a Product Manager?

**Varied Types Depending on the Product:** The type of person that better fit as a PM can differ significantly depending on the product. For instance, an API product manager needs more technical skills, whereas a consumer focused product manager for a service like Instagram needs to focus more on customer data and market.

### PM Step by Step:

1. **Research and Make a Plan:** Start by understanding the problem, then gather data about the market, users, competitors, etc., and plan how to solve it.
2. **Design and Spec:** Detail the specifications for the product to be built.
3. **Implement and Test:** Here, engineering does their job while the PM guides the shape of the product and provides feedback.
4. **Release and Go To Market:** In this phase, the PM gathers user feedback and analyzes data to prepare for the market launch.

Using the data and market responses, the PM takes cues on how to improve the product and what to do in the next cycle.

### Myths around Product Management

Today, it was covered some of the myths around Product Management, the conclusions mentioned were:

##### 1. PM is not a strictly defined role

It might be different from company to company, and even from product to product. For example, in a small startup, you might be the only PM, and you will have to do everything from research to design and implementation. In a large company, you might be a PM for a specific feature, and you will have to work with other PMs to make sure the product is cohesive.

##### 2. PM aren't mini-CEOs

PMs are not CEOs, they don't have the final say on the product, and they don't have the power to make decisions on their own. They don't have authority over most of the things. Although, some senior PMs can hire/fire people over their direct reports.

##### 3. PMs don't do only management

PMs are not only managers, they are also people who do the work. Sometimes everything that nobody else wants to do or doesn't know how to do, goes to the PM. They are the ones who have to figure out how to do it.

##### 4. PM is not only about building the product

While building the product is a big part of the job, it's not the only thing that PMs do. There are many other things that PMs do, like talking to customers, doing research, analyzing data, etc.

##### 5. PMs are not the only ones who can have ideas

Although PMs can have ideas, everyone else can have ideas too. In fact, most of the time, the best ideas come from other people, not from PMs.

##### 6. PM is not only for technical people

PMs don't have to be technical, although it might help if they are, but there are a lot of other skills needed to do the job well, like focusing on the user, understanding the market, etc.

##### 7. PM job is not done when the product is released

PMs don't just release the product and then move on to the next one. They have to keep working on it, improving it, gathering feedback, making sure that it's successful, etc.

##### 8. PM is not required only in tech companies

They are needed in other industries too, like healthcare, finance, etc. The real job is to solve problems, and there are problems everywhere.

##### 9. Being a PM is not easy

It requires a lot of work, be attentive to every product meeting, have context on everything, come with solutions, understanding a lot of things, etc.

### What is Product Thinking?

It's the process of going from knowing the user's problem to building a product that solves it.

### What is Product Market Fit?

It's when there is a clear need for the product in the market, and the product is the best solution for that need. </br>

### Product Thinking Process

1. **Understand the problem:** This can be done by talking to users, doing research, etc.
2. **Market Opportunity:** Research if there is an opportunity in the market for the product, how big is the market, how much money can be made, etc.
3. **Solution:** Sometimes it might come with multiple solutions, then it needs to choose the best one, considering: ROI, limitations, alignment with the company's goals, etc.

### Business Goals

Business goals are important, some of them are:

- **Increase revenue**
- **Increase profit**
- **Increase market share**
- **Increase market share**

The PM is key in order to keep reaching and increasing them. </br>

#### Products Outcomes

Although PMs are not responsible for the business goals, they are responsible for the product outcomes, which can lead to the business goals. Some examples: </br>

- Increasing revenue by increasing the conversion rate to paid user <br>
- Increasing profit by reducing the cost of the product <br>
- Improving product quality <br>
- Enhancing the user experience <br>
  etc.

Business outcomes come from product outcomes. </br>

### [Day 5:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day5)

### Discoverying the real problem from the user

Many PMs don't understand the real problem that the user has, or at least all the problems. </br>

#### The "Why" Framework

The "Why" framework is a way to get to the root of the problem. It consists of asking "Why" multiple times until you get to the root of the problem. That number is just indicative, sometimes even 3 times is enough. </br>

#### Examples:

**Case 1:** The user often experiences the app crashing and slow performance. </br>

1st Why? Answer: The server storage is insuficient. </br>
2nd Why? Answer: The server is not scaled to support increasing user demands. </br>
3rd Why? Answer: The wasn't monitorization of the server usage and perfomance optimization. </br>
4th Why? Answer: The team didn't have visibility of the server usage. </br>
5th Why? Answer: The didn't have the tools to monitorize the server usage. </br>

**_Root Cause:_** The team didn't have the tools to monitorize the server usage, preventing them to know when to scale the server. </br>

**Case 2:** The app crashed again. </br>

1st Why? Answer: It was pushed a new API to the server recently. </br>
2nd Why? Answer: Because we launched a new feature that probably didn' use the API correctly. </br>
3rd Why? Answer: We have an engeenering who doesn't know how to use the API. </br>
4th Why? Answer: He never was trained on how to use the API. </br>
5th Why? Answer: The manager wanted to get him in production as soon as possible. </br>

**_Root Cause:_** Untrained engineer was pushed to production. </br>

### Best practices while applying the "Why" framework

1. Listen more than you talk. </br>
2. Formulate open-ended 'why' questions. </br>
3. Be ready to challenge the assumptions, encourage critical thinking. </br>
4. Iterate and refine. As you encounter the root cause, re-evaluate everything to make sure you are getting the deepest root cause. </br>
