### What is a Product Manager?

**An Octopus Connecting All Parts:** I like to think of a PM as an octopus connecting all the parts of the product to make it work well.

### Who is a Product Manager?

**Varied Types Depending on the Product:** The type of person that better fit as a PM can differ significantly depending on the product. For instance, an API product manager needs more technical skills, whereas a consumer focused product manager for a service like Instagram needs to focus more on customer data and feedback.

### PM Step by Step:

1. **Research and Make a Plan:** Start by understanding the problem, then gather data about the market, users, competitors, etc., and plan how to solve it.
2. **Design and Spec:** Detail the specifications for the product to be built.
3. **Implement and Test:** Here, engineering does their job while the PM guides the shape of the product and provides feedback.
4. **Release and Go To Market:** In this phase, the PM gathers user feedback and analyzes data to prepare for the market launch.

Using the data and market responses, the PM takes cues on how to improve the product and what to do in the next cycle.
