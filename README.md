# 30 Days of Product Management Challenge #30DaysOfPM

## Overview

This repository documents my journey through a [#30DaysofPM](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/30-days-of-pm) challenge. Each day, I delve into different aspects of Product Management, from understanding user needs to collaborating with development teams.

## Daily Breakdown

## [Day 1:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day1)

### What is a Product Manager?

<img src="/images/octopus.png" width="500" alt="Octopus Product Manager">

**An Octopus Connecting All Parts:** I like to think of a PM as an octopus connecting all the parts of the product to make it work well.

### Who is a Product Manager?

**Varied Types Depending on the Product:** The type of person that better fit as a PM can differ significantly depending on the product. For instance, an API product manager needs more technical skills, whereas a consumer focused product manager for a service like Instagram needs to focus more on customer data and market.

### PM Step by Step:

1. **Research and Make a Plan:** Start by understanding the problem, then gather data about the market, users, competitors, etc., and plan how to solve it.
2. **Design and Spec:** Detail the specifications for the product to be built.
3. **Implement and Test:** Here, engineering does their job while the PM guides the shape of the product and provides feedback.
4. **Release and Go To Market:** In this phase, the PM gathers user feedback and analyzes data to prepare for the market launch.

Using the data and market responses, the PM takes cues on how to improve the product and what to do in the next cycle.

### Myths around Product Management

Today, it was covered some of the myths around Product Management, the conclusions mentioned were:

##### 1. PM is not a strictly defined role

It might be different from company to company, and even from product to product. For example, in a small startup, you might be the only PM, and you will have to do everything from research to design and implementation. In a large company, you might be a PM for a specific feature, and you will have to work with other PMs to make sure the product is cohesive.

##### 2. PM aren't mini-CEOs

PMs are not CEOs, they don't have the final say on the product, and they don't have the power to make decisions on their own. They don't have authority over most of the things. Although, some senior PMs can hire/fire people over their direct reports.

##### 3. PMs don't do only management

PMs are not only managers, they are also people who do the work. Sometimes everything that nobody else wants to do or doesn't know how to do, goes to the PM. They are the ones who have to figure out how to do it.

##### 4. PM is not only about building the product

While building the product is a big part of the job, it's not the only thing that PMs do. There are many other things that PMs do, like talking to customers, doing research, analyzing data, etc.

##### 5. PMs are not the only ones who can have ideas

Although PMs can have ideas, everyone else can have ideas too. In fact, most of the time, the best ideas come from other people, not from PMs.

##### 6. PM is not only for technical people

PMs don't have to be technical, although it might help if they are, but there are a lot of other skills needed to do the job well, like focusing on the user, understanding the market, etc.

##### 7. PM job is not done when the product is released

PMs don't just release the product and then move on to the next one. They have to keep working on it, improving it, gathering feedback, making sure that it's successful, etc.

##### 8. PM is not required only in tech companies

They are needed in other industries too, like healthcare, finance, etc. The real job is to solve problems, and there are problems everywhere.

##### 9. Being a PM is not easy

It requires a lot of work, be attentive to every product meeting, have context on everything, come with solutions, understanding a lot of things, etc.

## [Day 3:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day3)

### What is Product Thinking?

It's the process of going from knowing the user's problem to building a product that solves it.

### What is Product Market Fit?

It's when there is a clear need for the product in the market, and the product is the best solution for that need. </br>

### Product Thinking Process

1. **Understand the problem:** This can be done by talking to users, doing research, etc.
2. **Market Opportunity:** Research if there is an opportunity in the market for the product, how big is the market, how much money can be made, etc.
3. **Solution:** Sometimes it might come with multiple solutions, then it needs to choose the best one, considering: ROI, limitations, alignment with the company's goals, etc.

## [Day 4:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day4)

### Business Goals

Business goals are important, some of them are:

- **Increase revenue**
- **Increase profit**
- **Increase market share**
- **Increase market share**

The PM is key in order to keep reaching and increasing them. </br>

#### Products Outcomes

Although PMs are not responsible for the business goals, they are responsible for the product outcomes, which can lead to the business goals. Some examples: </br>

- Increasing revenue by increasing the conversion rate to paid user <br>
- Increasing profit by reducing the cost of the product <br>
- Improving product quality <br>
- Enhancing the user experience <br>
  etc.

Business outcomes come from product outcomes. </br>

### [Day 5:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day5)

### Discoverying the real problem from the user

Many PMs don't understand the real problem that the user has, or at least all the problems. </br>

#### The "Why" Framework

The "Why" framework is a way to get to the root of the problem. It consists of asking "Why" multiple times until you get to the root of the problem. That number is just indicative, sometimes even 3 times is enough. </br>

#### Examples:

**Case 1:** The user often experiences the app crashing and slow performance. </br>

1st Why? Answer: The server storage is insuficient. </br>
2nd Why? Answer: The server is not scaled to support increasing user demands. </br>
3rd Why? Answer: The wasn't monitorization of the server usage and perfomance optimization. </br>
4th Why? Answer: The team didn't have visibility of the server usage. </br>
5th Why? Answer: The didn't have the tools to monitorize the server usage. </br>

**_Root Cause:_** The team didn't have the tools to monitorize the server usage, preventing them to know when to scale the server. </br>

**Case 2:** The app crashed again. </br>

1st Why? Answer: It was pushed a new API to the server recently. </br>
2nd Why? Answer: Because we launched a new feature that probably didn' use the API correctly. </br>
3rd Why? Answer: We have an engeenering who doesn't know how to use the API. </br>
4th Why? Answer: He never was trained on how to use the API. </br>
5th Why? Answer: The manager wanted to get him in production as soon as possible. </br>

**_Root Cause:_** Untrained engineer was pushed to production. </br>

### Best practices while applying the "Why" framework

1. Listen more than you talk. </br>
2. Formulate open-ended 'why' questions. </br>
3. Be ready to challenge the assumptions, encourage critical thinking. </br>
4. Iterate and refine. As you encounter the root cause, re-evaluate everything to make sure you are getting the deepest root cause. </br>

### [Day 6:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day6)

### Product Discovery

Product discovery is the process of understanding the problem, the user, and the market. </br>

#### Difference between Product Discovery and Product Thinking

Product Thinking = A broad framework considering the entire product. </br>
Product Discovery = it's more focused, dealing with validating the specific ideas and features, backed by data. </br>

It's like a topic within Product Thinking. </br>

#### Product Discovery Steps

1. **Empathy and Understanding:** Understand the user's needs and emotions. </br>
2. **Clarifying the problem:** Nail down one sentence that covers the entire problem. </br>
3. **Make sure you are solving the right problem:** How big is the problem for the user. </br>
4. **Priorating the problem:** What user's problem to solve first. </br>
5. **Reframing the problem:** Reframe the user's problem into chunks that can be solved, then figure out a plan to solve them. </br>
6. **Prototyping:** Create a prototype to quick test the solution with the users. </br>
7. **Verify the tests:** Verify the tests with the users to analyze if the proposed solution is solving the problem. </br>

---

### [Day 7:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day7)

### Design Thinking

It's a mindset approach to solve problems in a creative way focusing on the person who has the problem. </br>
So it's a way to solve problems in a user-centric way, instead of problem-based. </br>

#### Design Thinking Steps

1. **Empathize:** By understanding the person affected by the problem you can find a more impactful solution. It uses also data through the research. </br>
2. **Define:** Once you have accumulated enough data, you can define the problem statements. There are a lot of methods to do it. </br>
3. **Ideate:** Brainstorming ideas to solve the problem. </br>
4. **Prototype:** Create a prototype to investigate the ideas. </br>
5. **Test:** Test the prototype with the users to see if it solves the problem. This phase is experimental, so it isn't about perfection, but seeing which parts work and which don't. </br>

### [Day 8:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day8)

### JTBD (Jobs to be Done) Framework

It's a framework to understand the user's needs and real motivations when using a product. </br>

#### How to use it?

<img src="/images/when.png" width="500" alt="JTBD Framework">

When I ... (context) </br>
But ... (barrier) </br>
Help me ... (goal) </br>
So I ... (outcome) </br>

### Tips to use it

1. **Clear audience definition:** Narrow down the audience to a specific group of people, with clear characteristics, without risk of being too broad. </br>
2. **Do market research:** Understand the audience, what they currently are using to solve the problem and where they feel the most pain. </br>
3. **Talk to the users:** Using surveys, interviews, etc, identify the user's mindset and decision process. </br>
4. **Prioritize the JTBD**: Prioritize the JTBD based on the user's pain points and the business goals. </br>

### Example - Discord product

**When I** want to play a game </br>
**But** I don't know if there are people around to play, </br>
**Help me** to coordinate with other people to play, </br>
**So I** can easily find a way to enjoy my favorite game. </br>

This suggest features like making it easy to find people through the search serves and switching easily from text to voice chat. </br>

### [Day 9:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day9)

### User Research

Some benefits of doing user research (talk to users): </br>

- save development, time and redesign costs
- increase the chances of user satisfaction
- increase conversion rates
- gets qualitative feedback
- help to understand what matters to the user
- gain competitive advantage
- help to make product easier to use, shorter learning curve for the user
- improve UI/UX

#### User Research Methods

- **Qualitative research:** It gets direct feedback from the users. Ex.: interviews, focus groups, etc. </br>
- **Quantitative research:** It gets data from the users. Ex.: surveys, analytics, etc. </br>

#### Two types of user research approaches

- **Attitudinal:** listening to users' words, ex.: interviews, focus groups, etc. </br>
- **Behavioral:** observing users' actions, ex.: watching users using the product, A/B testing, etc. </br>

#### Some user research methods applied

- **Studying data:** if you collect data, then you can analyze it to understand the user's behavior. </br>
- **Usability testing:** watching users using the product to understand how they use it and what problems they have. </br>
- **User interviews:** usually 30min to 1h, speaking to one user at a time, face to face or remotely. Misunderstandings can be clarified immediately. A downside is that it's time-consuming and expensive. </br>
- **Online surveys:** some questions to a large number of users, to identify patterns. It tells an average of the user's behavior. </br>

### [Day 10:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day10)

### How to do user interviews

#### Types of user interviews

- **Structured:** You follow a list of questions. Sometimes even a script. The collected data is more quantitative. </br>
- **Semi-structured:** It's more flexible, you prepare a list of questions but they can be adjusted during the interview. </br>
- **Exploratory:** Open-ended questions, it flows as a natural conversation. Useful to uncover new insights. </br>

#### Things to take into account while doing user interviews

- **Define the goal and scope:** What do you want to learn from the user? Plan the questions accordingly. </br>
- **Find participants:** Find people who fit the target audience. Don't ask friends or family, they might be biased. </br>
- **Give participants context:** Explain the purpose of the interview and scope, but don't give too much information that might bias the user. </br>
- **Analyze the data:** After the interviews, analyze the data to find patterns and insights. </br>
- **Summarize in personas:** Use the insights from the interviews to create personas. </br>
- **Follow up:** After the interviews, follow up with the participants to thank them, let them know how their feedback will be used and keep them updated about the project. </br>

#### Initial introduction template

- **begin with a brief introduction:** "Hi, this is \_\_\_\_\_, from \_\_\_\_\(company)\_\_\_. Is it a good time to talk?" </br>
- **thank the user for their time and tell how important it is:** "First of all, I'd like to thank you for talking with me today. It's incredible valuable for me to get, to listen to you talk to me through your personal experience and how things work (and don't work) in your world, so I really appreciate it." </br>
- **ask an overview question:** "Could you start by telling me a little bit about how you \_\_\_\_\_(perform general task)\_\_\_\_\_ currently? </br>

### [Day 11:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day11)

### User Segmentation

Dividing the users into groups based on their characteristics. </br>

#### How doing user segmentation can be useful?

it helps to understand each group needs and behaviors, so you can tailor the product to each group. </br>

sometimes it's not possible to satisfy all the users, so it's important to know which group to focus on. </br>

#### example of using user segmentation data

per example, if you only can add 3 new features to a community swimming pool (product example), you should focus on the group that uses the pool the most, and features that benefit also the other groups. </br>

example of choosing the new features: </br>

<img src="/images/features.jpeg" width="500" alt="Choosing Features">

#### How to segment users?

Types of user segmentation: </br>

- **Demographic**: gender, location, age, income, language, etc. </br>
- **Device**: mobile, desktop, etc. </br>
- **Acquisition source**: how the user found the product, ex.: social media, search engine, etc. </br>
- **Usage patterns**: how often the user uses the product, how long, etc. </br>

### [Day 15:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day15)

### Problem Statement

It's a clear and short description of the problem that the product is trying to solve. </br>

#### Why have a problem statement?

- focus on the problem, not the solution. </br>
- inspire the team to solve the problem. </br>
- prevent misunderstandings. </br>

#### How to write a problem statement?

**have a clear problem:** it should be clear what the problem is. </br>

### [Day 16:](https://30daysofpm.substack.com/p/day16)

### The Ideation Process

It's the third step of the Design Thinking process. </br>

It's not about finding the best solution, but generating as many ideas as possible. </br>

#### "How Might We" Framework

While there are many ways to generate ideas, one of the most popular is the "How Might We" framework. </br>

It's a way to reframe the problem into a question that can be answered with a solution. </br>

#### Examples

**Problem:** I want to go to the supermarket. </br>
**How might we:** make it easier to go to the supermarket? </br>
**Solution:** I can order online and get it delivered. </br>

**Problem:** Users are not engaging with the app. </br>
**How might we:** increase user engagement? </br>
**Solution:** Add a new feature that users will like. </br>
